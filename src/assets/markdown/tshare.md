#### Summary

I invested in a 22 week intensive program called [Nucamp](https://www.nucamp.co/bootcamp-overview/full-stack-web-mobile-development) to hone my software engineering skills. For our final project, I was tasked with builing a web app from scratch. I wanted to create something that could help people connect in a brand new way.

#### Solution

I built T-share, a shirt that breaks the ice for you. Our users recieve a shirt with a QR code printed on it, and cusotmize what happens when people scan it using our web app. This includes playing games, cracking jokes, announcing messages, and asking people on dates. Here’s a snapshot of the control center, and what it looks like to ask someone out with the shirt:

Here are some of the t-shares I made. Quite dorky, but they attracted a lot of attention and I enjoyed making them.

Here are some of the coolest things I’ve used my T-share for:

1. Before I moved to Germany to participate in CBYX, friends and families wrote their goodbyes and saw others on a ‘Reddit Thread’ feature
2.  I got someone’s phone number with the ‘ask on data’ feature
3.  I made someone’s day by saying ‘You are beautiful’ to a stranger who was curious about my shirt
