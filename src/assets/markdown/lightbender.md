#### Blending Light, Dance, and Music in a mix-media performance

Lightbender was a mixed-media performance that I presented at a local open mic project that allowed me to explore the possibilities of combining technology and art. I used the Python OpenCV computer vision library and an arduino to create a system that translated dance movements into dynamic light patterns on an LED strip, creating a visual display that was synchronized to the music. Here is a video of the performance
